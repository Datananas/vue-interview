# Datananas - Vue.js job interview

This project has been generated by `vue-cli`

You can therefore use `yarn serve` to start the application (and all other default commands)

## Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to build a page of contacts. This page must contain:
- A search field for earch contacts
- A list of contacts

You should be able to type something in the search input, that will query the API.

This should update the list contacts contacts according to the search (or no search)

The API endpoint is available here [https://tfuvom2ai5.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/production/contacts](https://tfuvom2ai5.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/production/contacts)

You can search on the API by using a `search` param : [https://tfuvom2ai5.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/production/contacts?search=rick](https://tfuvom2ai5.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/production/contacts?search=rick)

## Submission

1. Clone this repository and create a new branch `feature/search`
2. Build everything required
3. Push your code to a **private** repository you created on Github
4. Create a Pull Request from your branch to `master` with a nice description
5. Grant a read access to [romainsimon](https://github.com/romainsimon) & ping me at romain@datananas.com

## Rules

1. You do not talk about this interview to anyone
2. You DO NOT talk about this interview to anyone. This means **never** publish your code in a public repository or give access to other. This would ruin it for us.
2. You must create your own components and cannot use external components libs (Vuetify, Element, etc...)
3. You can if you want add any CSS lib (Tailwind, Bootstrap, ...)
4. You can add any lib you want (vue-x, axios, etc..) - except [volkswagen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/volkswagen)
5. We will never reuse this code anywhere
